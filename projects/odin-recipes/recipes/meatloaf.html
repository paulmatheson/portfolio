                <p>
                    Good old-fashioned meatloaf stands alongside hot dogs and apple pie as iconic American foods. That's
                    not
                    to
                    say
                    any of those dishes actually originated in America, but that hasn't stopped us from embedding them
                    deeply
                    into
                    our culture and lore, and making them our own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meatloaf especially is a product of ingenuity and making-do as thrifty, waste-not home cooks combine
                    low-cost
                    ingredients to make a satisfying main dish that will stretch ingredients and feed a family. Yet, as
                    a
                    highly
                    customizable recipe, meatloaf can be found everywhere from classic diners to high-end restaurants,
                    to
                    everyday
                    dinner tables.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>
                    Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook onion and garlic until onion is soft and
                    translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>Combine onion and garlic mixture, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream,
                    Worcestershire
                    sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce in a large bowl. Mix until well combined. Gradually stir in milk, 1
                    teaspoon
                    at a time, until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.</li>
                <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200
                    degrees

                <li>Mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and
                    continue
                    baking for 10 minutes. </li>
