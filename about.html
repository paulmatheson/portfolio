                <p>
                    I’m from (and based-in) Seattle, WA and I’ve worked with computers for as long as I can
                    remember.
                    When I only about 11, I would use platforms like Homestead and Geocities to build websites
                    around
                    the things I was interested in (Dragon ball Z and beatboxing) and as I grew older, I became
                    self-taught and proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a developer with an eye for good design, I have a passion for creating beautiful websites and
                    collaborating with others to envision digital spaces that exceed their expectations.
                </p>

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>

            <p>
                I’m an Aries so I have far more interests than I know what to do with. I’m keenly interested in
                photography and music production. In my free time, I love playing video games, taking care of my house
                plants, and finding new bars and restaurants to try with friends.
