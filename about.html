                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™m from and based-in Seattle, WA where Iâ€™ve dabbled with and worked on computers for as long as I
                    can
                    remember.
                    When I only about 11, I would use platforms like Homestead and Geocities to build websites
                    around
                    the things I was interested in (like Dragon ball Z and beatboxing) and as I grew older, I became
                    self-taught and proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For a few years I worked in hardware
                    repair, fixing iPhones and MacBooks where I continued to hone my technical skills until I took a
                    position as a project manager at Avanade where I've now been for 5 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a developer with an eye for good design, I have a passion for creating beautiful websites and
                    collaborating with others to envision digital spaces that exceed the needs of the client. I've
                    worked with clients like iDope Customs and <a href="www.seattledancecollective.org">Seattle Dance
                        Collective</a>.

            <p>
                Iâ€™m an Aries so I have far more interests than I know what to do with. Iâ€™m keenly interested in
                photography and music production (stemming from the aforementioned beatboxing). I've collaborated with
                and made beats for some of Seattle's best talents (<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gHuT__Vu84&pp=ygUIbXkgdm9sdm8%3D">Grynch</a>, <a

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aBzkBebGc">RA Scion</a> to name a few). I also made (most of)
                the beats for <a

                    Ape
                    Theory</a>. In my free
                time, I love playing video games, taking care of my house
                plants, writing, and finding new bars and restaurants to try with my wife and friends.
